## Keys takeaways from this course are :-
* GitHub Copilot is an AI coding assistant that helps you write code faster and with less effort, allowing you to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration.

* To get good amount of accuracy we need to write some comment about what we are trying to build, then it will provide suggestions based on our comment

* It's not 100% accurate code even if we write comments about the next requirements, we still need to have proper knowledge about the coding technologies

* Copilot is just for suggestions and less of typing if it gives us right code. So it's us(developer) has to decide whether to accept/not the suggested code by copilot or write our own logic.

* Therefore if a developer don't have proper knowledge of coding, then, even Copilot can't help him/her write better code or build better software

* Copilot cannot replace a software developer with proper coding knowledge
